    <td>Hades fell in love with Persephone, goddess of spring. However, the feelings were not returned as Hades kidnapped her  and brought her to the Underworld. Demeter, Persephoneâ€™s mother, was devastated about this, stunting the growth of the crops (winter). Hades made a deal with Demeter that she would be obligated to stay with him for six months as she ate six pomegranate seeds, and would return to the living world for the rest.</td>
