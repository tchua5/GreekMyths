    <td>Zeus' father, Kronos, had many powerful children. He feared that when they grew older, they would overpower him. To ensure this wouldn't happen, he ate all his children besides Zeus, as he was the youngest. Zeus saw this as wrong and tricked his father into eating a rock, causing Kronos to throw up Zeus' siblings. They all defeated Kronos with their powers, cutting him into a million peices and throwing him into Tartrus.</td>
